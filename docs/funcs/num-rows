%set(name,num-rows)
%set(syntax,%%num-rows%%)
%set(description,Returns the number of rows in the result of an SQL query. 

%%num-rows() is valid only in the footer arguments to the %%sql() macro. While the rows of a query are enumerated\, the num-rows is incremented.)
%set(author,)
%set(example,%%sql(MyDSN\,"SELECT * FROM Table"
   \,Row %%num-rows%% --- %%column(1)<br>
   \,
   \,%%num-rows%% items were selected
)

The above code fragment reads through the Table table in MyDSN\, 
prints out a "row label" and the values of the first field\, 
one line per row\, and then summarizes a count at the bottom.

The output will look something like:

Row 1 --- bob<br>
Row 2 --- charlie<br>
2 items were selected)
