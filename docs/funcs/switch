%set(name,switch)
%set(syntax,%%switch(cond0\,'case0[\,cond1\,'case1[\,...][\,'defcase]))
%set(description,Test one or more conditions and expand the matching case. If no matches are 
found\, expand the optional default case.

- The conditions are tested in order. 

- The case expressions will typically be quoted so that only one is expanded. 

- When used with 2 or 3 arguments\, %%switch() is identical to the %%if() macro\, but is slightly slower. 

- This macro is not auto-quoted\, that is\, you must explicitly type in a single 
quote mark in front of each case to ensure that only one of the cases is 
expanded)
