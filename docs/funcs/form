%set(name,form)
%set(syntax,%%form(name[\,instance]))
%set(description,%%form() returns the value of a form variable passed to the document as the result of either a POST or GET method HTML form

- %%form() will decode the variable by calling %%url-decode() internally. 

- The first time %%form() is used\, all form variables are scanned\, decoded\, and 
processed. Later invocations of %%form() will be much faster. 

- When first expanded %%form() will define macros with the same name as as the 
form variables\, set to the correct values\, as long as a macro with the same 
name doesn't already exist.

- For example\, instead of writing %%set(foo\,%%form(foo)) you can just write %%form
(foo). 

- You can also declare %%form() (or %%form%%)\, with no parameters\, to generate 
variables for all of the form variables that don't conflict with existing macro 
names. 

- For multiple-select form controls that create multiple variables with the 
same name\, %%form%% takes a second parameter which indicates which instance of 
the variable you want: %%form(foo\,2) or %%form(foo\,0). 

- %%form%%\, automatically defines variables; you can access multiple instances of 
them with a subscript: %%foo(0) or %%foo(2).)

%set(example,If your query string looks like this: foo=12&foo=34&bar=16 then:
%%foo%% and %%form(foo) will expand to 12
%%foo(0) and %%form(foo\,0) will expand to 12
%%foo(1) and %%form(foo\,1) will expand to 34
"%%bar%% will all expand to 16)
