%set(syntax,%%client-url%%)
%set(description,Returns the URL of the current HTTP session\, without any appended query 
information.

- The query can be obtained using %%client-query%%.

- There is no way to determine if the document was fetched with a "?" without
query data (the stuff after the "?"). 

- If the URL did not specify a document\, and therefore the default document was 
fetched\, %%client-url%% will not show the default document's name.)
