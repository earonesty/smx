%set(name,include)
			%set(description,"Syntax 1 \"includes\" a file name.  It is reccomended that you included a full path or use the %%fqppath\(\) function.  If you want the filename to be parsed, you should use %%expand\(%%include\(filename\)\).<br>

Syntax 2 retrieves the contents of an http[s] url.  

The Windows version supports the same options as \"qweb\" \(http://www.q32.com/qweb.htm\), since it shares the same source base.  So you can specify a username, password, certificate file, and much more.

On Linux, for now, just use %%exec\(wget -O -...\) or %%exec\(lynx -source ...\).")
			%set(syntax,"syntax 1: %%include\(filename\)
syntax 2: %%include\(http://url\)")
