%set(name,for)
%set(syntax,%%for(var\,a\,b\,'body[\,step]))
%set(description,var is set to a\, then body is repeatedly expanded\, and var incremented\, until 
a = b. (var will be decremented if a > b). step can be used to cause the 
increment to be other than +/- 1; its sign will automatically be adjusted to 
make sure the loop terminates. 

If the macro max-iteration is defined\, it sets an upper limit to the number of 
loop iterations that will be allowed\, regargless of the loop's condition 
statement. This macro can be useful for debugging potentially infinite loops\, 
or in a production environment where an accidental infinite loop's impact on 
server performance would be problematic.
