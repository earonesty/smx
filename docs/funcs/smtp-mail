%set(description,"Send mail using SMTP

SMTP is the main e-mail protocol for the Internet. 

%%smtp-mail\(\) requires that you have access to an SMTP server. 

   %%server should be the hostname or IP address of the SMTP gateway. 
   %%acct should be your POP account information. 
   %%from should be the e-mail address of the message's sender. 
   %%to should be the semicolon-delimited list of the message's recipients. 
   %%subject should be the message's subject, and body its body. 

Do not include any SMTP headers in either parameter -- they will be added automatically by %%smtp-mail\(\).

%set(example,"%%smtp-mail\(mail.smxlang.org,root,smx@q32.com, erik@primedata.org,\"Hello!%%crlf%%I just want to say hi!\"\)

For now, attachements are filenames, not file content. 

We may support some syntax that signified literal text inserted as an attachment, with a specified disposition, etc, if anyone asks for it.")
