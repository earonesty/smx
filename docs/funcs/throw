%set(name,throw)
%set(syntax,%%throw(exception-num\, exception-name))
%set(description,This macro throws an exception.  The default behavior of exceptions is to simply print the exception at the current location UNLESS it is in a %%try() block.  Inside of a try block\, the processing will be halted\, and the "catch" handler will be expanded instead. 

You can put ALL of your pages in a try block by setting %%http-exception to a function which handles all exceptions in yout INIT macro for your web server.  In this way the throw macro will always abort processing.)
