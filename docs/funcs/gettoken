%set(name,gettoken)
%set(syntax,%%gettoken(string\,separators\,token))
%set(description,Extract an element from a delimited list of values. 

- %%gettoken() is useful when processing a list of string values delimited by 
special characters\, such as spaces\, tabs\, or commas. 

- string is the list of string values. 

- token identifies which element to extract (0 is the first). 

- separators is a string which contains all characters that should be 
considered as token delimiters. 

- %%gettoken() is patterned after the C strtok function. 

-  Note that one or more delimiters in a row are considered to be one 
delimiter\, e.g. for the list one\,\,three\, three is the second token.)
