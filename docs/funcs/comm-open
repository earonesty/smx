%set(description,%%comm-open opens a communications port\, and then exposes the %%comm-write and %%comm-read functions within the body.

%set(author,)
%set(example,This will write SOMEBYTES to COM1\, and wait up to 1 second to read an 8 
byte response.

%%comm-open(
   COM1
  \,baud=9600 data=8 parity=N
  \,WRITING: %%comm-write(SOMEBYTES) ...
   READING: %%comm-read(8\,1) ...
)

You can also read delimited responses 

EG: %%comm-read(\,1\,%%asc(9)) - reads untill an ascii "9" is seen - waits 
at most 1 second maximum.)
