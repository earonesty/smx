%set(name,expand)
%set(description,"%%expand expands its argument as a macro.  This is VERY unsafe to do with user-supplied content, please use safe-expand instead.  

Typical usage for %%expand is to partition code into libraries and then load them as needed, for example %%expand\(%%include\(/path/to/file\)\) will evaluate the contents of that file, potentially creating or redefining functions.")
%set(syntax,"%%expand\(macro-text\)")
%set(example,"%%set\(x,%%%%iadd\(1,1\)\)

The result of %%x%% is %%expand\(%%x%%\).

-----

The result of %%iadd\(1,1\) is 2.
