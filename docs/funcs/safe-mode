%set(name,safe-mode)
%set(description,"%%safe-mode allows multiple users sharing an apache server to swite scripts that modify data on the server to coexist without being able to modify each other's data.

SMX checks the owner of the script and won't allow the script to read or modify a file unless it is in a directory owned by the same user.

SMX also disables %%exec and other macros that are potentially dangerous in a shared-user environment.

%%safe-mode cannot be turned off.

In order to be effective, %%safe-mode should be set in the serverwide \"http-init\" macro \(See example below\).
")
%set(syntax,"%%safe-mode\(T\) - enable safe mode
%%safe-mode%% - return current safe-mode value

%set(example,"Put this in Apache's conf:

SMXInit %%gset\(http-init,'%%safe-mode\(t\)\)
