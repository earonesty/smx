%set(name,while)
%set(syntax,%%while('cond\,'body))
%set(description,Iteratively expands the body argument while cond evaluates to non-null. Returns 
the concatenated result of the evaluated bodies.

- Both arguments should be quoted to defer evaluation. 
- cond is evaluated before body is expanded for the first time; if cond is 
  initially %%null%%\, the macro will expand to %%null%%. 
- %%while() is patterned after the C while loop. 
- do and %%while() differ in that do will immediately expand body and then 
  checks the condition to see if body needs to be done again\, whereas %%while() 
  checks cond first\, and will not expand body unless cond returns T. 
-%%while() does not have a local context\, so you don't need to use %%gset(). 
  If the macro max-iteration is defined\, it sets an upper limit to the number 
  of loop iterations that will be allowed\, regargless of the loop's condition 
  statement. This macro can be useful for debugging potentially infinite loops\, 
  or in a production environment where an accidental infinite loop's impact on 
  server performance would be problematic.

%%set(i\,3)
%%while('%%lt(%%i%%\,6)\,   
   'I=%%i%%<br>    
   %%set(i\,%%iadd(1\,%%i%%)))
"At the end\, I=%%i%%"

Returns:
I=3<br> I=4<br> I=5<br> "At the end\, I=6")
