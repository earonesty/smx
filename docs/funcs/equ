%set(syntax,%%equ(a\,b[\,delta])
%%=(a\,b[\,delta]))
%set(description,Compares numbers a and b and returns T if a = b. Otherwise\, %%null%% is returned. 

Often\, floating-point calculations will introduce rounding errors. The delta 
parameter provides a means of how close the numbers' values must be so that 
they are considered equal. If delta is specified\, the comparison will be 
|b - a| < delta. If an argument is not a valid number\, it will be treated as if 
it were 0.)
