%set(name,do)
%set(syntax,%%do('body\,'cond))
%set(description,Iteratively expands the body argument while cond evaluates to non-null. Returns 
the concatenated result of the evaluated bodies.

- Both arguments should be quoted to defer evaluation. 

- cond is not evaluated until body has been expanded at least once. 

- %%do() is patterned after the C do loop. 

- %%do() and while differ in that %%do() will immediately expand body and then 
checks the condition to see if body needs to be done again\, whereas while 
checks cond first\, and will not expand body unless cond returns true 

- %%do() does not have a local context\, so you don't need to use %%gset(). 

- If the macro max-iteration is defined\, it sets an upper limit to the number 
of loop iterations that will be allowed\, regargless of the loop's condition 
statement. This macro can be useful for debugging potentially infinite loops\, 
or in a production environment where an accidental infinite loop's impact on 
server performance would be problematic.)
