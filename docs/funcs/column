%set(name,column)
%set(syntax,%%column(columnID))
%set(description,Obtains the value of the given column for the current row in an SQL query\, 
either by name or by number.

- %%column() is valid only when used in the rowpattern argument to the sql 
macro. 

- columnID can be either the column's number or its name (field name). Column 
numbers start with 1; the 0th column (the bookmark column) cannot be accessed. 

- Columns are numbered in the order they appear in the SELECT statement; or\, if 
* is used\, in the order they are specified in the underlying datasource. 

- The implementation of %%column() imposes a very slight penalty for using a 
column's name (field name) instead of its number. We recommend using column 
names whenever possible for code legibility. 

- It is difficult to determine the name of calculated columns in advance\, so 
the use of numbers is recommended for them. %%column-name() can obtain the name 
of a column by number if it's needed)
