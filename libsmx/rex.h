/* CEx : simple exception info:

	try {
		... 
		throw(qEx(4, "Error on port #%d. %y", port, GetLastError())) ;
		...
	} catch (CEx *ex) {
	... 
	}

	
	your catch handler then gets an id 
		and a nicely formatted message for printing

	the format string is standard printf 
	... with the addition of a "%y" code
		which takes a GetLastError() code and translates it to a 
		error description
	
	
	qExV is for building new wrapper Ex functions

	rcEx assumes the id is a resource-string-id and uses it 
		to grab a message from the resource fork
		windows resources, however, aren't very portable

	rcExF adds "ERROR %d : " to the fromt of the message
