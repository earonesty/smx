**** ABOUT

smx is a macro-parsing system

it allows the use of text-embedded macros that are delmited
by a "magic character". the traditional magic character is "%"

for example, you can include

%header%

some text

%footer%

in your documents, and then use smx to parse them.

or

%counter(home-hits)

in your web pages

**** PREEQUISITES

yum install or apt-get:

	unixODBC unixODBC-devel sqlite sqlite-devel httpd-devel

optionally, for image support:
	
	gd, gd-devel - for image support
	tdb - for alternative to sqlite for %pset and %counter databases

**** INSTALL

Should be able to run 

	./configure
	make
	make install

If you did a git update, and you get a libtool error, run 

	make clean

smx uses autotools, so you should be able to use --prefix, and other
typical configure settings.

For example, to make a debug build

	make clean all CFLAGS=-ggdb CXXFLAGS=-ggdb

**** APACHE CONFIG

Add this to your apache conf:

	LoadModule /usr/local/lib/libmodsmx.so

And then add

	AddHandler smx-parsed .htm
	AddHandler smx-parsed .html

If you want it to magic-mode-parse html files.  You must put 
%expand% at the top of magic-mode files, or they are 
passed-through to apache as regular html.

Add SMXInit <code-to-run> to your conf, if you want a 
global-init (your probably want this).

These globally defined macros affect the operation 
of the apache module:

	http-user	- defines a basic auth handler
	http-badurl	- defines a 404 handler
	http-init	- defines a per-page expanded macro (good for %module)

You should read about %safe-mode if you have untrusted
users writing macros.  man %safe-mode

**** CGI CONFIG

If you want to run it as a CGI, put

#!/usr/bin/smx -c

At the top of your CGI scripts.  %expand% magic is 
not necessary for CGI

**** FASTCGI SUPPORT

/usr/bin/smx-fcgi is installed as well.  Use this for servers 
that support fast-cgi.  It's much faster than CGI.

The environment varialbe SMX_INIT can be used for initialization macros.

smx-fcgi can be used as an auth filter, but only if the http-user macro
is defined somewhere via SMX_INIT.


**** Compiling an RPM distribution

make dist
cp smx-1.1.*.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
rpmbuild -bb --clean smx.spec
